# README

I am collecting my progress towards accomplishing a simple challenge here. The challenge will help to get me acquainted with [terraform](https://terraform.io), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) in general.

The Challenge: Create a solution to push arbitrary data onto some sort of permanent storage using state of the art frameworks.
